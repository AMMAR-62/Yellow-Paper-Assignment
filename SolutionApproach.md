**First of All there are three approaches which i know in text summarization and I implemented all of them in python**
---
 PS: I found some amazing tutorials on youtube about all the three algorithms and how to implement them, I also took help from blogs and Machine Learning books. The methods are:
 1. The TF-IDF Approach
 2. The Term Frequency Approach
 3. The Bag of Words Approach.

**Then I made a flask app from scratch and put some UI in it**
---
- I provided the definitions of All the three in the home page to beautify the UI of website.
- I provided the input tags and the methods to select from in the project page
- I provided a small about me project as well.
---

**Finally I connected the logic and Deployed it to AWS**
---
 - I already had an AWS account, so I deployed the flask app after verifying that the project is fully working.
